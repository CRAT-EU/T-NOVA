# Cluster Deployer Tool

 To deploy the cluster of Controllers, cluster-deployer script can be used.
 
 Make sure Python 2.7 is installed on your host
 ```
 sudo apt-get install python2.7
 ```
 Also, install pip and paramiko
```
 sudo apt-get install python-pip
 sudo apt-get install python-paramiko 
```

Then, run the command below where the Integration repo resides (This is for Lithium distribution. If you are deploying with Helium, choose distribution-karaf-0.2.3-Helium-SR3.zip file).
```
 python deploy.py --clean --distribution=/user/local/distribution-karaf-0.X.Y-SNAPSHOT.zip --rootdir=/root --hosts=10.125.136.51, 10.125.136.52, 10.125.136.53 --user=foo --password=password --template=multi-node-test
```

The Controller clusters will be deployed in /root/deploy/current/odl/ folder in the respective machine hosts. To check the features that are installed, start the controller in the following way -
```
 ./bin/client -u karaf
 feature:list -i
 ```
